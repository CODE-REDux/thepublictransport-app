# Contribution to TPT

The guides are easy: Every new contribution should be based on the WIP branch, which is our develop branch. 
After some tests of your contribution, we will merge it into the WIP branch.

We don't guarantee that your contribution will take place into the stable release, that's what the maintainers have to consider.
